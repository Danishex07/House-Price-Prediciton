# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
The House Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, etc. The model utilizes historical housing data to train a machine learning algorithm, which can then predict the price of a new house given its features.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project involves extensive data preprocessing to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for training the machine learning model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training**: The cleaned dataset is used to train a machine learning model, typically a regression model since the task involves predicting a continuous target variable (house price). Various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting are commonly used for this task.
- **Model Evaluation**: Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess its performance in predicting house prices accurately.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters of the machine learning algorithms are tuned using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize the model's performance further.
- **Deployment**: After training and evaluation, the model is deployed either as a standalone application or integrated into a web application where users can input the features of a house and get the predicted price as output.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The project involves continuous improvement by updating the model with new data periodically and retraining it to adapt to changing market trends and patterns.
