# House-Price-Prediciton

In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as transaction date, house age, location factors, and nearby amenities. By analyzing historical housing data and leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to build models that can provide reliable predictions of house prices.

The project is divided into several key steps, including:

1. Importing libraries: We begin by importing the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2. Data exploration and preprocessing: This step involves loading the dataset, exploring its structure, handling missing values, and preprocessing the data to prepare it for modeling.

3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): We conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices). This helps us understand the dataset better and identify potential patterns.

4. Feature engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. This step is crucial for extracting relevant information from the dataset.

5. Machine learning models: We train and evaluate several machine learning models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, random forest regressor, decision tree regressor, support vector regression, KNN regressor, and artificial neural network. Each model is assessed based on its performance metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

6. Conclusion: Finally, we summarize the findings of the project and discuss the performance of the different machine learning models. We also provide recommendations for future improvements and extensions to the project.

By the end of this project, we aim to develop accurate and reliable models for predicting house prices, which can be valuable for various stakeholders in the real estate and finance industries.
